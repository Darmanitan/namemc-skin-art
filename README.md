# info
this is a namemc skin art bot forked by chrommies version.

added: auto refresh namemc (that's about it lol.)

⚠️ may take up to 30+ minutes to apply skins due to namemc rate limit. nothing i can do about that ⚠️
# Usage
Put your image in the directory as `input.jpg`, run `main.py` and paste in your bearer token. It will generate the image files, and start sending requests to mojang. You must update the NameMc profile by reloading every time it tells you to. It will delete all the temp files at end
